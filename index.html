                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Rock Sliders That Keep You Protected</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Anyone who takes their 4Runner off the pavement knows that rocky trails, logs, and uneven terrain can cause serious body damage. Rock sliders act as a shield, protecting your rocker panels from dents, scrapes, and costly repairs. Beyond protection, they also serve as a stable step for easier vehicle access. For the </span><span>3rd gen 4Runner</span><span>, rock sliders are one of the smartest investments you can make to maintain both performance and value.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Imagine climbing over jagged rocks and hearing the scrape of metal against stone, without sliders, that sound often means expensive damage. With our sliders installed, that same sound is simply steel doing its job. It’s protection you can rely on, trip after trip.</span></p>
                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Highlights That Matter Most</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Our 3rd gen 4Runner rock sliders aren’t just another aftermarket accessory. Every set is crafted with careful attention to durability, function, and fitment. Here’s what sets them apart:</span></p>

                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● DIY/Weld-It-Yourself Design</span><span> – Perfect for those who enjoy custom fabrication or want to add a personal touch.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● Precision Fit</span><span> – Designed specifically for 3rd gen Toyota 4Runners (1996–2002), ensuring the right clearance and alignment.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● Trail-Tested Strength</span><span> – Proven to stand up to rocks, stumps, and tough trail conditions.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>With these highlights, it’s easy to see why off-roaders trust our sliders. They’re not just made to look good, they’re built to perform under pressure.</span></p>

                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Real-Life Situations Where Sliders Shine</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>To understand the true value of sliders, picture yourself in common off-road scenarios. Maybe you’re crawling over a boulder and your rocker panel is inches away from contact. Without protection, one slip could leave a deep dent. With our sliders, the steel takes the hit, sparing your 4Runner from costly damage.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Or perhaps you’re loading gear onto your roof rack for a camping trip. Instead of struggling to reach, you use your sliders as a stable step. They become more than just protection, they’re part of your daily convenience.</span></p>
                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Who Will Get the Most Out of This Product</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>These sliders are designed for anyone who values both adventure and vehicle protection. Whether you’re new to off-roading or an experienced driver, you’ll appreciate the durability and utility they bring. Families who love camping trips benefit from the added step access, while serious trail drivers can trust the strength to handle direct rock impacts.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Even if you don’t spend every weekend on trails, the peace of mind is worth it. Everyday driving hazards like curbs or hidden obstacles in parking lots can also cause damage that sliders help prevent.</span></p>
                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Inside the Box</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>When your order arrives, you’ll find a complete DIY slider kit with all necessary pre-cut parts. Our packaging ensures nothing is missing or damaged in transit. Inside, you’ll find:</span></p>

                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● Frame mounting plates</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● Weld-ready connections</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● Instruction guide</span></p>
